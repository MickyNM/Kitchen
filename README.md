# Project "Kitchen"

## Java
The site was created in the Java programming language. Named "Kitchen" because it depicts what most of us love :)
It has wide possibilities, depending on the needs of the user. It works with the database (SQLite), allowing the user to very easily work: enter, delete or update data.
It can be used for restaurants, cafes, bars...
